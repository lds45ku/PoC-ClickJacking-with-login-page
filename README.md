<h2>What is ClickJacking? 🤔 </h2>
ClickJacking (also known as User Interface redress attack, UI redress attack, or UI redressing) is a malicious technique where a web user is tricked into clicking on something different from what they perceive, potentially revealing confidential information or taking control of their computer while interacting with seemingly harmless web pages.
A server that doesn’t return an X-Frame-Options header is vulnerable to ClickJacking attacks. The X-Frame-Options HTTP response header is used to indicate whether a browser should be allowed to render a page within a <frame> or <iframe>.
Websites can prevent ClickJacking attacks by using the X-Frame-Options header to ensure their content isn’t embedded in other sites.    <br>
